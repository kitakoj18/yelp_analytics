    "Topic modeling involves identifying topics that are latent in the text that contain them. LDA assumes that a corpus is generated by a topic, which is generated by words belonging to that topic. However, with reviews, this might be an incorrect assumption to make because a reviewer isn't necessarily keeping to a certain topic in a review; a review rather might convey a positive or negative tone about many parts of the experience. They might talk about the quality of the products, the service, the ambiance of the store - a wide range of topics. Therefore, we might not find a particular theme in each of the LDA components, but more of things that are commonly said together in comments. Something to try out later is applying this with kMeans.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think it might be meaningful to be able to identify reviews that contain mentions of specific products and see what these reviews are saying about that product. Extract the entire review this mention is in but also take the specific sentences talking about the product and do a sentiment analysis to see if they're generally positive or negative."

      "I think I'm in love with this place! The moment I walked in the first time, I felt as though the atmosphere was made for me. I don't want to describe the atmosphere as \"chill,\" but honestly, I cannot think of a better word. The decorations are minimal, the tables are minimal, even the employees seem minimal. this place is a minimalist's dream. The service was nice, everyone seemed so patient. Parking is a private lot in the back, but it's usually full. The music they play there is just quite enough for you to block it out if you want to. \n",
      "Honey truffle latte: YUM! The flavor of the truffle was perfectly done. Usually I don't enjoy truffle because the flavor is too dominant, but this cup of latte was great. I had a sip of this cold, and it just didn't do the truffle any justice compared to the hot. If you order this, definitely opt for the hot option.\n",
      "NBC latte: yum! Absolutely perfect amount of cinnamon in this! This is similar to a Spanish latte at Urth Caffe, but I definitely prefer the NBC. The flavors were more mild, but they melded together so much better than a Spanish latte. \n",
      "Blue blood orange lemonade: good but not great. This was WAY too sweet when I had it. I had to wait for the ice to melt, but after the ice melted, it tasted great! I don't necessarily remember tasting the actual blood orange, but the lemonade did taste really good, and it is very photo-worthy.\n",
      "I love the fact that is is open until 3AM and there is it's own parking lot. Since this is in Ktown, having it's own lot just makes me feel so much safer. Coffee is great here, not too strong, but not too mild. I love it!\n",

The other unique coffee drinks are amazing as well, but I have to say I was very disappointed in the tea I got because it was nothing special. \n",

It actually suits my taste because it is very easy to drink and has a very smooth texture. But as you keep drinking it, it gets sweeter, so I probably will order less sweet or try something else next time. Also, it is interesting that they chose to use cups without a handle, makes me want to sip it slowly. \n",

I like to come on the weekends cause there's plenty of street parking on Wilshire and Wilton that's free after 4pm.\n",

I tried the Truffle Honey Latte, which I thought was interesting but I'll probably stay clear of it. The truffle is definitely noticeable in the aftertaste, and I don't think I really liked it in my latte. Don't forget to get a punchcard! Your 10th drink is on the house.\n",

I had to ordered an extra to go as it was so delicious. Perfectly sweetened and crunchy on the ends. The place is barely new but there were like three customers while I was there.

      "\n",
      "In terms of the menu, there is a huge selection of coffee. You can either get your typical hot teas, vanilla lattes, to their speciality NBC latte. They also have charcoal latte, but I am not sure if it's good. Price wise, you'll definitely spend around $5-$6 per drink. But, they also have scrumptious waffles that is made fresh, and it fills up the entire cafe. Yum! \n",

      "I always either get their NBC latte or green tea matcha latte. For the NBC latte, I get it with their almond milk, and woo! It's so good! It has a cinnamon stick in it, and it really is a nice cinnamon latte. You can taste the espresso, but the sweetness from the milk and sugar makes it smooth and good. I also love their matcha latte. It's a little sweet, but you won't get robbed from the matcha flavor. \n",

They do allow you to double park, but it's such a pain in the next might as well not do it. But, I would say it's worth trying to come and stay. Or, if you can Uber here, that's probably better too. \n",
