However, the barista was super nice and he was ok with my pup being there). \\n\\nThe interior was pretty cool - their layout had seats that would be a good spot to bring your friends and hang out. I'd definitely come here again to try some of their other drinks and snacks.\""

    "Topic modeling involves identifying topics that are latent in the text that contain them. LDA assumes that a corpus is generated by a topic, which is generated by words belonging to that topic. However, with reviews, this might be an incorrect assumption to make because a reviewer might not stick to a certain theme. The review might convey a positive or negative tone but I would say it isn't always the case that a reviewer sticks to talking only about one or two things in a review. They might talk about the quality of the products, the service, the ambiance of the store i.e. a wide range of topics. Therefore, we might not find a particular theme in each of the LDA components, but more of things that are commonly said together in comments. Something to try out later is applying this with kMeans.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think it might be meaningful to be able to identify reviews that contain mentions of specific products and see what these reviews are saying about that product. Extract the entire review this mention is in but also take the specific sentences talking about the product and do a sentiment analysis to see if they're generally positive or negative."

I don't want to describe the atmosphere as \"chill,\" but honestly, I cannot think of a better word. The decorations are minimal, the tables are minimal, even the employees seem minimal. this place is a minimalist's dream. The service was nice, everyone seemed so patient. Parking is a private lot in the back, but it's usually full. The music they play there is just quite enough for you to block it out if you want to. \n",
      "Honey truffle latte: YUM! The flavor of the truffle was perfectly done. Usually I don't enjoy truffle because the flavor is too dominant, but this cup of latte was great. I had a sip of this cold, and it just didn't do the truffle any justice compared to the hot. If you order this, definitely opt for the hot option.\n",
      "NBC latte: yum! Absolutely perfect amount of cinnamon in this! This is similar to a Spanish latte at Urth Caffe, but I definitely prefer the NBC. The flavors were more mild, but they melded together so much better than a Spanish latte. \n",
      "Blue blood orange lemonade: good but not great. This was WAY too sweet when I had it. I had to wait for the ice to melt, but after the ice melted, it tasted great! I don't necessarily remember tasting the actual blood orange, but the lemonade did taste really good, and it is very photo-worthy.\n",
      "I love the fact that is is open until 3AM and there is it's own parking lot. Since this is in Ktown, having it's own lot just makes me feel so much safer. Coffee is great here, not too strong, but not too mild. I love it!\n",

It actually suits my taste because it is very easy to drink and has a very smooth texture.

      "The interior of the coffee shop is really cute! I definitely got it give it to them to put a lot of effort and care into their aesthetics. They have a huge cherry in the middle of the shop with wooden tables and a bunch of plugs. They also do a really good job in maintaining the store. \n",

      "In terms of the menu, there is a huge selection of coffee. You can either get your typical hot teas, vanilla lattes, to their speciality NBC latte. They also have charcoal latte, but I am not sure if it's good. Price wise, you'll definitely spend around $5-$6 per drink. But, they also have scrumptious waffles that is made fresh, and it fills up the entire cafe. Yum! \n",

      "I always either get their NBC latte or green tea matcha latte. For the NBC latte, I get it with their almond milk, and woo! It's so good! It has a cinnamon stick in it, and it really is a nice cinnamon latte. You can taste the espresso, but the sweetness from the milk and sugar makes it smooth and good. I also love their matcha latte. It's a little sweet, but you won't get robbed from the matcha flavor. \n",

I would rate my recent visit 3.5 stars.\\n\\nINTERIOR\\nI was very impressed by the spacious and clean interior! Most of the new coffee shops are small and barely have any tables to accommodate their guests. Nothing But Coffee had a lot of small tables, seats on the bar, and some chairs. I also loved that they had electrical outlets for those who wish to stay to work or study. The decor is simple and very neat. The coffee shop was very empty when I went, probably because it hasn't been long since it opened. \\n\\nCOFFEE\\nI ordered the most expensive drink on their menu, the truffle honey latte for $6. The one other unique item I saw on their menu was their NBC latte but I decided to try the drink they were advertising on their front entrance. I ordered it iced and less sweet. The barista was very friendly checked up on me to make sure that I liked the drink and the sweetness adjustment. The latte was served in a cute 500mL beaker, a very appropriate cup for the nerd in me who stayed in their coffee shop to write my lab reports. \\n\\nThe coffee itself was very interesting, something I have never tried before. The drink was very light in color,  so there is a lot of milk and probably barely any coffee in it. Or maybe it doesn't even have coffee, I couldn't tell. The truffle flavor was an interesting addition. There is some sweetness from the honey but the predominant flavor is white truffle. It leaves a lingering earthy flavor that stands out before any other flavor in the latte. I enjoy white truffle oil in breads and salads, but I wasn't sure of how I felt drinking it in a milky beverage. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it either. I drank about 250mL out of the approximate 550mL (I roughly know because of the beaker measurements) and already felt tired of the milky truffle flavor. The truffle honey latte was definitely not my cup of tea (or should I say, not my cup of coffee). It is definitely a unique item on their menu, but I personally wouldn't order it again.\\n\\nOverall, Nothing But Coffee is a nice and clean coffee shop. I love the interior of the shop and the friendliness of the barista who helped me. I wouldn't come back for the truffle honey latte, but I might try something different on my next visit.\""
